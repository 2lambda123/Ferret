! demonstrates bug 1205; precision of LEV_DEL when single level specified.

shade/lev=.4d/x=1:10/y=1:10 cos(i/10)*9*sin(j/5)
sh sym lev_del

! Why does the following fail when run as part of the benchmarks?  ZMIN and ZMAX 
! computed in stmnmx have the values of  xmin and xmax instead of zmin and zmax, 
! but it works fine alone, not here at the end of the benchmarks...
!
! use coads_climatology
! shade/l=1/lev=.4d sst; sho sym lev_del
