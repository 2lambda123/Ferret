## Site-dependent definitions included in Makefiles

## Machine type for which to build the local external functions
## Use $(HOSTTYPE) to build natively for the machine you are using
# BUILDTYPE	= $(HOSTTYPE)
BUILDTYPE	= x86_64-linux
# BUILDTYPE	= i386-linux
# BUILDTYPE	= intel-mac

## Installation directory for the locally built external functions
FER_LOCAL_EXTFCNS = $(FER_DIR)/ext_func/libs

## =========================
## C and Fortran compilers to use.  The construct "$(shell which gcc)" assigns
## the response to "which gcc" run from a Bourne shell (such as bash).
## When compiling for Mac OS X, one may wish to use clang instead of gcc.
## =========================
# CC = $(shell which clang)
CC = $(shell which gcc)
FC = $(shell which gfortran)

## =========================
## Linker used to generate executables and shared-object libraries.
## Normally the Fortran compiler is used which then calls the actual
## linker with appropriate flags and system-level Fortran libraries.
## The construct "$(shell which gfortran)" assigns the response to 
## "which gfortran" run from a Bourne shell (such as bash).
## =========================
LD = $(shell which gfortran)
