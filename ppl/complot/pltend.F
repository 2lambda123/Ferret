C     THIS SUBROUTINE IS USED TO INDICATE THAT A DISPLAY HAS
C     BEEN COMPLETED.  ON THE TEKTERMINAL, EXECUTION IS SUS-
C     PENDED UNTIL THE USER RESPONDS BY ENTERING A CHARACTER
C     FROM THE KEYBOARD.  THEN THE SCREEN IS ERASED AND THE
C     ALPHA CURSOR IS MOVED TO THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF
C     THE SCREEN.  ON THE PRINTRONIX PRINTER PLOTTER, THE BUFFER
C     IS DUMPED AND CONTROL IS RETURNED TO THE CALLING PROGRAM.
C     ON THE ZETA AND BENSON PLOT-
C     TERS, IF PLOTTING HAS BEEN DONE SINCE THE LAST CALL TO
