## Full path name of the directory containing this file (the ferret root directory).
## Do not use $(shell pwd) since this is included in Makefiles in other directories.

## Machine for which to build Ferret
## Use $(HOSTTYPE) to build natively for the machine you are using

## Installation directory for built Ferret.  Using the "install"
## Makefile target circumvents the need to create the fer_*.tar.gz
## files just for creating a Ferret installation.

##
## If the readline provided by the system is not actually GNU readline 
## (e.g.; on Mac, where it is actually editline), it may not have the
## ability to specify a function to repeatedly call while waiting for 
## user input (the rl_event_hook).  Ferret uses this ability to keep 
## plot windows refreshed and responsive, so in this case, an actual 
## GNU readline (and history) static library must be built and installed. 
## The installation directory (contains the subdirectories "include" 
## and "lib") should then be specified here and these libraries will 
## be statically linked in.
##
## If the readline provided by the system does provide this required 
## functionality (i.e; is GNU readline, which is the case for most 
## Linux systems), do not define this value (or leave it blank).
## In this case the system readline and history libraries will be 
## used (dynamically linked in).
##
# READLINE_DIR = /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.3_1

## Java home directory - this may be already defined from your shell 
## environment.  If JAVA_HOME is defined, $(JAVA_HOME)/bin/javac and 
## $(JAVA_HOME)/bin/jar is called to build threddsBrowser.jar; 
## otherwise, threddsBrowser.jar is not built and the Ferret command
## SET DATA /BROWSE (or the alias OPEN) will not work.
